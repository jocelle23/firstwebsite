                <!-- Assigned a class attribute to format this paragraph. -->
                <p class="centerp">I graduated from UNLV with a Bachelor's in Business Adminstration
                and Management. Shortly after graduating, I entered the supply chain industry as a supervisor. 
                I've enjoyed sharpening my leadership and communication skills these last few years. However, 
                I've realized my passions lie elsewhere. I love to travel, hike, and socialize with friends
                and family. I also enjoy building computers and playing games online (mainly LoL right now).
                I truly enjoy working with technology. Some of my hobbies have fueled my excitement in 
                joining the tech industry. </p>
